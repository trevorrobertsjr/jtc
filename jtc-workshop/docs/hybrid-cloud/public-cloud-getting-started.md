# Setting up our Public Cloud on Amazon S3

Let us create an Amazon S3 bucket and put our data file there.

First, let's get our data file that we will use for the workshop: <a href="/files/nyc_reviews.csv" download>Download NYC Reviews CSV</a>

The data file contains 1000 reviews of New York City that I generated using ChatGPT. If you are interested in working with real data on a larger scale, you can always check sites like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and listings of [free public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).

Now that we have our data, let's host it on AWS
