# Workshop Introductions

This lab provides an opportunity to get hands on with popular technologies your teams may use to host your ML and data pipelines. Even if you are more interested in software development than in working with cloud technologies, it is a good idea to be conversant in what the cloud can do for your teams.

The goal for this workshop is to give you a high-level overview of popular cloud services that can be useful for your ML/data projects. Enjoy!
